                <p>In the capitalist nightmare world we find ourselves currently living in, a world with only artificial scarcity, everyone is a content creator. Doesn’t matter who you are, what you do, or what your qualifications happen to be, you are a Creator. Some work in the medium of words on Twitter or Substack, others might post photos to Insta, or videos to YouTube, but without Fail, we all have to feed the Content Machine.</p>
<p>What is the Content Machine? It’s hard to explain, but it’s sort of a snake that surrounds the world, eating its own tail. It is a system but also a state of mind. It’s centralized but also distributed. It’s a virus that has snuck its way into the human species and infected everything.</p>
<p>Have you ever been watching your child play, heard them say something funny, then rushed to Facebook to tell everyone? You’ve been infected. Have opinions about Palestine that you have to get off your chest? Reddit is there for you. Does your hair look good today? After a few minutes of tuning you can throw your plastic face on Instagram.</p>
<p>And what do you get in return for turning all of your human experiences into Content? Some random person clicks a pixelated heart and you get a millisecond of serotonin. Multiple that by a couple hundred and you have literally seconds of joy a day.</p>
<p>As it stands, all we have left to do is feed the content machine. Every sunrise, school play, and Christmas morning are just fuel for the machine. Banal human interactions become fodder for melodramatic Tik Tok videos. Everything exists to serve the content machine. You only have one job now: to consume and create content.</p>
<p>But giving our lives in service to the content machine isn’t enough. After we’re done selling off everything we hold dear, the machine chews it up, digests it, and shits it out through AI. Your content becomes a part of someone else’s content. And the cycle repeats into a culturally stagnant future. And in that distant time, when humans have gone extinct, content will still be cycling through the machine, a simulacra of a simulation of a copy. World without end.</p>

                <div class="post-content e-content">
<p>Star Wars fans have been known for years as obsessives who will go to great lengths to explain every minutia in the galaxy far, far away. Every single piece of Darth Vader’s armor has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVzc20Bm8Xo">detailed background</a>, down even to the name of the medical center where his various operations were performed. There are timelines that trace history from the Big Bang to the a period decades after the battle of Endor. There are lists of what books and comics to be read and it what order. In other words, Star Wars is a lot like religion.</p>
<p>It’s so much like religion, in fact, that Star Wars has some canonical, apocryphal, and deuterocanonical works. And every fan has their own list of what counts as canonical. Officially, everything created after the Disney purchase, plus the original and prequel trilogies, are considered canonical, but a good chunk of fans don’t adhere to that orthodoxy. I mean, who cares about the Captain Phasma novel? It’s unimportant to the overall story. Average fans probably don’t even care the Clone Wars or Rebels shows, let alone The Book of Boba Fett.</p>
<p>The other day I saw a video on YouTube that asked a very important question: why doesn’t the original trilogy mention characters like Ahsoka or baby Yoda? If they were so important to the overall story, why weren’t they mentioned at all? Why did Obi Wan believe Luke to be the last Jedi when 114 of them had escaped the Emperor’s purge? Why did Yoda only say there was one other one? Are you telling me the great Yoda didn’t know about Ezra Bridger?</p>
<p>Like a rational person, you’re probably thinking “Of course the original movies didn’t mention characters that hadn’t been created yet.” And you’d be right. The video rightly points out that Star Wars canon is insane and doesn’t make any sense. It’s full of contradictions, retcons, and outright mistakes. There’s no way to reconcile the entire canon because each part was produced thinking only of itself and what came before. That there was no planned overarching story is obvious from the beginning. First, Darth Vader killed Luke’s father, then he became his father. Luke was in love with Leia and vied for her affection before becoming her brother. If the first and second films can’t agree, how can two dozen stories somehow form a coherent vision?</p>
<p>But this post isn’t really about Star Wars, it’s about Christianity. At the end of the day, that the Star Wars canon is contradictory and stupid doesn’t really matter. None of it affects my life except to take away a few bucks and some hours of my life. And if I decide to think of the Legends books as canonical, it’s not going to hurt anyone. But the Jewish and Christian canons, now that has real-world implications.</p>
<p>A good number of Christians believe the Bible, as is commonly published today, contains the words of God that present a factual account of the past. I know not every Christian sect believes this, but some version of it is the most predominant view. I was raised a fundamentalist Baptist, so we held to the most extreme view. The Bible was historically and theologically accurate. God created the universe in seven literal days. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were people. A couple million Hebrews left Egypt during the Exodus and wandered in the desert for 40 years. Saul, David, and Solomon were actual kings. Jesus was a historical figure who was born to a virgin and he actually spoke every red letter in the Gospels. Even when they say different things. And don’t get me started on Revelation; I don’t have enough time to show you all of the charts.</p>
<p>I bought in to this belief so hard I went to a Bible College and studied to become a missionary. I preached it to adults and taught it to children for years. But, like the Star Wars canon, the Evangelical understanding of the Bible doesn’t make any sense. There is no overarching story because they’re making it up as they go along. Multiple writers have differing beliefs and agendas and they aren’t all working towards a common goal. Some believe in multiple deities and others in monotheism. Some seem to follow El Elyon and others Yahweh. New Testament writers don’t seem to know any of the stories of the life of Jesus, especially of his divine birth.</p>
<p>Adding to that, you have a couple thousand years of tradition added to the supposed perfect truth. Things that are not obvious from the text are considered orthodox. But what is orthodoxy? It’s something some guys made up a few hundred years after the fact. It’s the original cinematic universe that you can’t think too much about or it all starts falling apart.</p>
<p>Unlike Star Wars, the Bible has a lot of relevance in our lives. People who believe the first day ever happened before there was a sun are making choices that affect the entire world. People that believe they have a god-given right to some land because a guy wrote it down in 500 BCE will do anything they have to maintain their power. People who believe in a deity that delights in burning millions of people forever are teaching your kids how to think.</p>
<p>I honestly can’t say what I really believe in right now. I’m kind of afraid of outright saying I don’t believe in anything because it’s hard to overcome your programming, but whatever I believe, I know the idea of a canon of scripture with a coherent story and theology doesn’t make any sense.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>I finally solved a problem I’ve had with Power BI over the past few months, so I thought I would put it in writing just in case anyone else is having the same issue. One of the my jobs is to monitor user productivity in my department, and I do that by using Microsoft Forms, Excel, and Power BI. Forms, for the users to input their numbers. <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"></sup>Excel, to store the data. And Power BI to report out to my bosses.</p>
<p>For one of the reports, we have two categories, A and B, and under each of those are multiple subcategories (1,2,3, etc). A user selects which category and subcategory they are entering data in for. The end result is a spreadsheet that has a column for A, a column for a values inputted for A, a column for B, and a column for all values inputted for B. This all works out just fine most of the time, but occasionally I would like for all subcategories under A and B to be in one column and their values next to it.</p>
<p>Basically, I want the data to be stored in both ways, so I can visualize it in multiple ways. I understand this is a problem of my own making and that I’m trying to have my cake and eat it too, but that’s just life.</p>
<p>Anyway, my solution to this self-inflicted wound is to create a new combined table (Modeling &gt; New table) and use the following DAX code:</p>
<pre class="language-sql"><code>Combined Table = 
UNION(
   SELECTCOLUMNS(Table1, "Type", [category_a], "Number", [number_done_a]),
   SELECTCOLUMNS(Table1, "Type", [category_b], "Number", [number_done_b])
)</code></pre>
<p>This allows me to create a table visualization that shows a list of all subcategories in A and B and their corresponding numbers.</p>

                <div class="post-content e-content">
<p>On the night of the 12th of January 2007, I was violently awakened by the apocalypse. You might not remember it because, as far you can tell, the world did not end in 2007. But for me it did. For my family it did. And for hundreds of thousands of others in the Ozarks, it certainly did.</p>
<p>The day began like any other. I woke up, took a shower, got dressed, and went into work. There was some small talk about the weather. Apparently, a big storm was moving into the area and the TV guy was calling for some ice. But the weather guys were always wrong, so I didn’t pay attention.</p>
<p>By the afternoon, I knew I had messed up. What began as cold rain soon turned into freezing rain, covering everything with a sheet of ice. I went to the grocery store, like everyone else in the city, and tried to stock up on supplies. All of the milk and bread was gone because people apparently eat milk sandwiches in bad weather. On the way home, the door on my car wouldn’t close because of the ice. I had to hold onto it with all of my strength while driving and trying not to die. But I did make it home.</p>
<p>That night we prepared for a bad winter storm. I brought in wood from outside in case we lost power. We turned the faucets on to a drip so the pipes wouldn’t freeze. And we sat and waited.</p>
<p>It came as the evening became night. The freezing rain continued pouring. A tenth of an inch became a quarter, then quickly became half. All told, we got an inch and half of ice. Power lines sagged and utility poles fell. Trees groaned under the excessive weight. They eventually snapped and rained down to the world below.</p>
<p>The branch of an old oak tree fell and hit our house. I’ve never been through an earthquake, but that’s what it felt like to me. The whole house shook violently, and the windows rattled. Surprisingly, there was no shattered glass but a good chunk of the corner of the roof was gone. The weatherhead was ripped from the house, plunging our world into complete darkness.</p>
<p>In a way, we were lucky. We had a fireplace and enough wood to last a few days. We didn’t freeze. We had plenty of food. The roof was broken but we had a secure enough shelter. Plenty of other people have had it worse and did have it worse.</p>
<p>I knew the world was coming to an end during the night. As the ice fell, electrical transformers became overwhelmed. One by one, street by street, neighborhood by neighborhood they exploded. Shards of light shot into the sky followed quickly by a short boom. In the calm nighttime hours, with no sounds of traffic or TV or gas furnaces, we could hear the grid being destroyed.</p>
<p>In the morning, the extent of the damage became clear. It looked like the aftermath of a tornado. Trees and other debris covered the streets while vehicles and homes were frozen solid. Maybe more than a tornado, a war zone or the aftermath of an explosion. In Southwest Missouri we’ve been through our fair share of storms, but this was unlike anything we had ever witnessed. It really was the end of the world.</p>
<p>But the subsequent days didn’t play out like you would have imagined. There were no large-scale riots or roving gangs robbing everything in sight. Sure, some people did steal generators but even with the police essentially out of service, life just went on as usual. Neighbors helped each other out. Civic groups and churches handed out food and water. Shelters opened for those who had nowhere to go. Groups of men walked the streets, chainsaws in hand, looking for people to help.</p>
<p>The biggest crimes were those committed by businesses. Hotels tripled or quadrupled in price while grocers raised staple prices. Kerosene skyrocketed in value as people stood in lines for hours just to get a precious few gallons. In other words, capitalism operated like capitalism: maximum profit for themselves, maximum pain for the rest.</p>
<p>Eventually, we ran out of firewood. Early one morning I walked out to the woodshed and grabbed the last few logs. I didn’t know what I was going to do after that, but for a few hours I would have heat. Later that day a guy I knew from church came by and loaned me a kerosene heater. That night, I vividly remember warming up a bottle for our six-month-old girl.</p>
<p>We sat by candlelight and listened to the radio. Vince Jericho, a local right-wing talk show host, stayed on the air almost all day. He took calls from people in need and from those offering help. He was the only news we had for days, and it kept us sane during a time of local insanity. He was our lifeline to the outside world. I would never have expected a fascist to have a soul, but I guess you can’t look a gift horse in the mouth.</p>
<p>For twenty-three days we were without power. Twenty-three days I couldn’t sleep in my own bed or shower in my own house. We had to rely on the kindness of our friends for hot water because we had an electric hot water heater.</p>
<p>The day the world came back was glorious. Some guy from out of state, drawn to the area by the money disaster brings, hooked our house up to the grid and lights shone. The furnace roared to life and brought life-preserving heat. Water warmed up and I took the best lukewarm shower I have ever experienced. Our landline phone worked again and we could communicate with the outside world. Our cellphones, batteries long since dead, could now recharge.</p>
<p>My story isn’t any more unique than yours. We’ve all faced crises, whether collective or individual. We’ve all suffered and had to do without. We’ve all felt as if the end of the world had come. And now we’re living in the post-apocalypse, in the aftermath of an earth-shattering event. But we made it through, mostly.</p>
<p>Sure, we have some new scars, but we’ve seen the possibility of a better world. Not a Lord of the Flies world, where we fight in the absence of law. No, a world of solidarity and mutual aid. A world of cooperation. A world that isn’t a zero-sum game.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>Hey seniors,</p>
<p>You don’t know me and I don’t know you. You’re a young adult about to leave high school and I’m just a semi-anonymous guy on the internet who has a few things to say. Even though you don’t have to, I’d really appreciate if you listened to what I have to say and consider it. Not because I’m an authority or anything but because I’ve been where you are and I wish someone had said these things to me 25 years ago.</p>
<p>During your graduation ceremony, you’re going to hear a lot of people tell you that you have a wide open future, that you can and should do anything you want. They’ll tell you to go out and change the world because only those with youthful enthusiasm can set things aright.</p>
<p>But listen, it’s all bullshit. They don’t want you to change the world. They want you to play it safe and stick to the status quo. They want you to go to university and accumulate a ton of debt while learning virtually nothing. They want you to take a boring job that supports their lifestyle, like finance or engineering. The only way they want you to change the future is by inventing some new device that distracts them from the hell-world they’ve created.</p>
<p>They want you to be a radical centrist. To fight for civility and norms and watching Fox News while you eat dinner. Feed the poor? Maybe on a Saturday afternoon after you just voted against legalizing sleeping in your car. Love your neighbor? Yeah, your middle-class white neighbor. Definitely not a refugee from Syria or a drug addict or -heaven forbid- a queer person.</p>
<p>They want you to sit in a church on Sunday and vote Republican or Democrat on Tuesday. Support the empire as it wages war across the globe and pretend you’re doing it for democracy. Watch the propaganda. Read the propaganda. Listen to the propaganda. Then spew it out on Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>I’ve seen this happen with my own generation. We were supposed to go out into the greatest economy the world had ever seen and shine the light of progress. What did it bring us? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. For all of our hard work to build the so called American Dream, we were left destitute. Debt, unaffordable housing, jobs that won’t pay a living wage. All while paying the consequences of the actions of those who came before us.</p>
<p>But we have Netflix now, so maybe it’s a wash.</p>
<p>When your graduation speaker tells you to go out and change the world, they really just want you to go out and support the neo-liberal world order. They want you to make life easier for them as they ride off into retirement.</p>
<p>If you really want to change the world, don’t let this happen. Destroy their generational wealth. Collapse their housing market. Topple the oligarchs. Send a message that inequality won’t be accepted. That war profiteers and criminals will be prosecuted. Tear down their racist institutions. Become ungovernable.</p>
<p>Create something better. An equal world where people are useful to each other. A world where your value comes from your humanity rather than what you provide to the economy. Create a society that respects the world as something sacred rather than a treasure to be pillaged. Build cities around people rather than cars.</p>
<p>I know things look bleak right now. I can’t lie and say I that I see a way out of this. We’ve dug a hole so deep we can’t even see the sun shining anymore. But don’t be tempted to despair. Disillusion and cynicism has killed the spirit of the generations before you. The work ahead of you is great and will involve a lot of blood, sweat, and tears, but it’s doable.</p>
<p>Be genuine.</p>
<p>Be kind.</p>
<p>Be radical.</p>

                <p>Every time a video emerges of police brutalizing and killing someone, liberals are quick to jump in and condemn the actions while defending the police state. “This is bad, and we need to fix policing in America”, they say from their suburban neighborhoods that only see cops when someone spots a poor person walking on the wrong street.</p>
<p>“We need more police”, they say without any hint of sarcasm. Yes, we need more armed psychopaths with licenses to kill. We need unaccountable men to go around and harass homeless people and make sure businesses are well protected against black teenagers.</p>
<p>“But if we reform policing in America, things will get better.” No, it won’t. It just won’t. You can’t reform something that is, by its very nature, irredeemable. The police don’t want reform and they’ll do everything they can to stop it. Look at what happened after the George Floyd protests, cops just stopped doing their jobs and held cities hostage.</p>
<p>You can’t negotiate with these terrorists because everything they have is predicated on them having absolute power. They aren’t going to willingly lay down their arms and try something different. These people are police because they can brutalize people, not in spite of it. Or, to use a phrase that’s kind of over played: the cruelty is the point.</p>
<p>The only way to move forward is to tear the system down and build something else. Patching things up won’t work.</p>

                <p>In a crushing victory reminiscent of the rebels destroying the first Death Star, <a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/politics/2022/07/26/springfield-council-votes-down-7-brew-coffee-proposal-sunshine/10148552002/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">neighborhood activists in central Springfield have defeated a plan to open up a 7 Brew drive through coffee place on Sunshine &amp; Jefferson in Springfield</a>. I’m not being sarcastic, this is really good news and shows that the people do have some power over the builders and developers who run this city. A rare win, and one that should give us courage in the future.</p>
<p>Royce Redding, local weasel and former Billy Long staffer, owns the property that was to be turned into a drive through. The lot, which has been vacant for years and occasionally serves as a place for community yard sales, is zoned as residential and Redding wanted the zoning changed to allow a new 7 Brew. (Because there aren’t enough already.)</p>
<p>The plan for the lot, after multiple rejections by the zoning board, was to have an entrance and exit on both Jefferson and Roanoke. Roanoke, a small residential street. This was done presumably because anyone of average intelligence could see that Sunshine wouldn’t be able to handle the added traffic. So they tried to pawn it off onto neighborhood streets. They also magnanimously offered to plant some trees on the back of the property.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this would benefit the people who live in the surrounding area, myself included. Their own research shows the majority of customers would be people driving along Sunshine. I wouldn’t be able to hop on my bike and ride over for a coffee because it’s a drive through only. I understand that no one is going to build a home on that corner (although an apartment building?), but a business should benefit the neighborhood.</p>
<p>I’m not glad we won because I’m some sort of home-value NIMBY. I was OK with the apartments built along the Greenway off of Sunset. I was OK with the 55+ duplexes on the other side of the street. I wouldn’t do anything to fight against more housing or responsible businesses because that’s good for the community. What’s not good for the community is another drive through restaurant with a line of cars flowing out into the streets. Starbucks, McDonalds, and the chicken nugget places already do enough of that.</p>
<p>It also doesn’t hurt that Royce Redding lost.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/05/what-did-police-actually-do-in-the-uvalde-shooting.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">In Texas, police stood by while a gunman murdered children inside a school.</a> The only action they took was to tase and pepper spray parents for daring to defy them. According to their chief, they could have been shot, so they did nothing. In fact, they did more than nothing. They stopped a Border Patrol team from entering the school because they didn’t believe the children were in danger. At that time children were on the line with 911 begging for help. Later, police action would directly lead to the death of a child. They tried to cover it up. It seems doubtful any of these officers or leaders will be held accountable.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aaastateofplay.com/the-50-schools-in-america-with-the-most-toxic-air" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">In Verona, Missouri, children are exposed to toxic air 665 times worse than the national average</a>. The BCP Ingredients plant has lead to a substantial increase in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and in some areas a 27 times higher than acceptable cancer risk. <a href="https://metrostl.com/2022/03/28/state-launches-cancer-study-after-toxic-air-pollution-hot-spot-is-identified/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">The plant says they are within state and federal compliance</a>. The EPA may fund another study but nothing else is happening.</p>
<p>Kanakuk, an evangelical Christian camp in Branson, <a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2022/05/26/kanakuk-kamps-abuse-unreported-decades-victims-say-missouri-pete-newman/9803409002/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">has been a haven for pedophiles for over thirty years</a>. According to campers and counselors alike, nudity was a part of the camp’s culture. <a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2022/05/26/camp-kanakuk-nudity-culture-hid-abuse-grooming-pete-newman-branson/9654342002/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">This “culture” included adults showering with children, watching them bathe, and inspecting their genitals for ticks.</a> <a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2022/05/26/kanakuk-kamps-camper-reported-sexual-assault-denied-call-home-leave/9827342002/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">A camper who was sexually assaulted by another camper was told to forgive her attacker and not allowed to call her parents.</a> Other campers who were molested were given gifts in exchange for signing a non-disclosure agreement. Kanakuk has faced no legal action and continues to operate.</p>
<p><a href="https://abuseguardian.com/agape-boarding-school-abuse-lawsuit-stockton-missouri-facility-under-investigation/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Agape Boys Ranch, a boarding “school” that moved into SW Missouri in 1990s because of a lack of regulation, has been abusing children for years</a>. <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article256914712.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">The facility’s doctor has been charged with multiple counts of child sex abuse.</a> He lived with two other staff members who have also been charged with sexual abuse. This man, who by law is a mandatory reporter, preyed on children for years. Law enforcement repeatedly refused to do anything until the KC Star and Springfield News-Leader began reporting on the school.</p>
<p>Circle of Hope Girls Ranch, another SW MO reformatory boarding school, faces similar charges. The ranch —now closed— was founded by a former employee of Agape in 2006 and almost immediately was the subject of abuse allegations. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/girls-alleged-abuse-reform-school-years-it-stayed-open-until-n1241011" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">In 2008 the Missouri Department of Education told a parent they could do nothing about the ranch because it wasn’t a licensed school</a>. That same year the Department of Social Services had received three complaints about the school, one of physical abuse and two of sexual abuse. Nothing ever came of those complaints. Sixteen years later the founders of the ranch face 100 criminal charges.</p>
<p><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/correction-christian-boarding-schools-missouri-story-83932551" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">It wasn’t until 2022 that the state of Missouri decided to do the bare minimum in regulating these so-called schools.</a> They don’t have to be licensed but all employees must be subject to a background check, adequate food and healthcare must be given to students, and parents are allowed access to their children with no prior notice.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, children were routinely the subject of public health experiments. Should they wear masks? Yes, but then no, but then yes. Should school be virtual? Yes, give every kid a laptop and who cares if they have a quiet place to do work. Actually, no, they need to come back to school unless someone tests positive and then the whole class needs to go home. Are there parents at home? Who knows. Do they have enough food to eat? Who cares.</p>
<p>After years of being jerked around by school boards made up of home builders and wannabe politicians, it’s become obvious these kids were robbed of a proper education. They lost years of their education and for what? I guess so they can grow up to be robbed of their wages by employers.</p>
<p><strong>I think it’s time for us to finally admit it: the society we live in hates our children.</strong></p>
<p>Even before they are born, they are subject to forces beyond their control. For absolutely no reason those born without enough food have to jump through increasingly smaller hoops in order to get public assistance. If you’re not lucky enough to have a parent with health insurance good luck trying to get on Medicaid. And even when you do, good luck finding a doctor’s office that will take it without lengthy delays. Where you lives determines what school you go to. Unsurprisingly, richer areas have better schools.</p>
<p>The deck is so stacked against kids. And every year it’s made more difficult to even survive. All of this for no reason at all. The United States is one of the wealthiest nations on earth and yet we find it better for one man to hoard billions of dollars rather than provide for all citizens. We would rather bomb villages thousands of miles away instead of providing safety for school children. We would rather scream about religious freedom than take care of the most vulnerable.</p>
<p>One of my core political tenets is solidarity. What happens to one, happens to all. Standing up for those who are vulnerable, for those who are weak, for those who are afraid is one of the most important things we can do. Standing against those who would use children as shields for their regressive politics is the purest form of solidarity.</p>

                <p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sgfcitizen.org/economy-growth/springfield-transportation/springfield-throws-2m-support-behind-a-wider-i-44/"&gt;The city of Springfield is going to toss $2M towards widening I-44 between 65 and Kansas Expressway&lt;/a&gt;. While 2 million is a drop in the bucket compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.springfieldmo.gov/DocumentCenter/View/55166/FY2021-22-City-of-Springfield-Adopted-Budget"&gt;proposed FY22 budget&lt;/a&gt;, we should probably expect the city and county will end up spending a lot more once the project is approved and construction begins in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;According to Kirk Juranas, assistant director of Public Works, the widening project coincides with the city’s desire to work on the 13/44 interchange. You know, that diverging diamond interchange that was going to greatly reduce traffic congestion and make life better for those coming to and from Willard? According to Juranas, “[The interchange has] functioned well for us, but we’re beginning to see backups and delays of up to 20 minutes, and we’re currently studying with the DOT and the Ozarks Transportation Organization options to see if we can’t make that better.”&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;But widening I-44 is going to make things better. &lt;a href="http://plazaperspective.com/road-widening/"&gt;Lane widening rarely, if ever, reduces traffic congestion&lt;/a&gt;. Adding additional capacity to the road system doesn’t reduce traffic,&lt;a href="https://t4america.org/maps-tools/congestion-con/"&gt;it creates more traffic&lt;/a&gt;. If, hypothetically, 10,000 vehicles per day pass through that stretch of the interstate, adding lanes will only increase the number of vehicles. You won’t have the same amount of vehicles passing through a larger area. It just doesn’t work that way.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;To use a local example that’s currently making me angry: building another Starbucks across town won’t reduce traffic at Sunshine and Campbell. It will just create more traffic in another part of town. More people will want their morning coffee at Starbucks, not the same amount (and definitely not fewer).[^1]&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;Beyond the inconvenience of more traffic, consider the environmental impacts. Increased traffic congestion is going to bring increased pollution with it.  How will the construction affect the storm water situation in Springfield? Are there plans to improve the system? And what about any green spaces in the area? Will they be filled with asphalt and concrete? Doling Park sits along I-44, will the park be reduced in size?[^2]&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;I’m not naïve, I understand that cars and trucks are here to stay and there’s little I can do about it. Our modern economy depends on them and until we succeed in creating a new economy, one that doesn’t sacrifice our lives, the lives of our children, and the planet itself on the altar of money, we will have to deal with cars.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;But creating more lanes isn’t the only thing we can do to reduce traffic congestion. Along with new construction, we must insist the city invest more in &lt;a href="https://www.springfieldmo.gov/5041/Bikeways"&gt;bike lanes&lt;/a&gt;, sidewalks, &lt;a href="https://parkboard.org/148/Parks-Facilities"&gt;green spaces&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://farefreesgf.com/"&gt;public transportation&lt;/a&gt;. We should works towards changing zoning ordinances to create denser mixed space areas rather than cookie cutter cul-de-sacs miles away from food and shopping.[^3]&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;Change is always a marathon and not a sprint. Big structural changes require educating the public about what works and doesn’t work. It’s easy to just build more lanes, but to actively plan a city around humans rather than cars is difficult. But in the long run it will be very much worth it.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;h2 id="footnotes"&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h2&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;[^1]: I really don’t understand why the city isn’t more aggressive towards these businesses that essentially use public streets as drive through lanes. If you build a Starbucks next to a McDonalds and Chick-fil-A, you should have to show that you’ll be able to handle peak traffic.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;[^2]: See &lt;a href="http://www.ijste.org/articles/IJSTEV2I8054.pdf"&gt;this survey of the literature&lt;/a&gt; on the environmental effects of traffic congestion.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;[^3]: I write this on 6 May 2022 after a week long storm system brought several inches of rain to the Ozarks. My neighborhood sewer main is clogged and we have to use as little water as possible for who knows how long.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
