You’re a young adult about to leave high school and I’m just a semi-anonymous guy on the internet who has a few things to say. Even though you don’t have to, I’d really appreciate if you listened to what I have to say and consider it. Not because I’m an authority or anything but because I’ve been where you are and I wish someone had said these things to me 25 years ago.</p><p>During your graduation ceremony, you’re going to hear a lot of people tell you that you have a wide open future, that you can and should do anything you want. They’ll tell you to go out and change the world because only those with youthful enthusiasm can set things aright.</p><p>But listen, it’s all bullshit. They don’t want you to change the world. They want you to play it safe and stick to the status quo. They want you to go to university and accumulate a ton of debt while learning virtually nothing. They want you to take a boring job that supports their lifestyle, like finance or engineering. The only way they want you to change the future is by inventing some new device that distracts them from the hell-world they’ve created.</p><p>They want you to be a radical centrist. To fight for civility and norms and watching Fox News while you eat dinner. Feed the poor? Maybe on a Saturday afternoon after you just voted against legalizing sleeping in your car. Love your neighbor? Yeah, your middle-class white neighbor. Definitely not a refugee from Syria or a drug addict or -heaven forbid- a queer person.</p><p>They want you to sit in a church on Sunday and vote Republican or Democrat on Tuesday. Support the empire as it wages war across the globe and pretend you’re doing it for democracy. Watch the propaganda. Read the propaganda. Listen to the propaganda. Then spew it out on Twitter and Facebook.</p><p>I’ve seen this happen with my own generation. We were supposed to go out into the greatest economy the world had ever seen and shine the light of progress. What did it bring us? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. For all of our hard work to build the so called American Dream, we were left destitute. Debt, unaffordable housing, jobs that won’t pay a living wage. All while paying the consequences of the actions of those who came before us.</p><p>But we have Netflix now, so maybe it’s a wash.</p><p>When your graduation speaker tells you to go out and change the world, they really just want you to go out and support the neo-liberal world order. They want you to make life easier for them as they ride off into retirement.</p><p>If you really want to change the world, don’t let this happen. Destroy their generational wealth. Collapse their housing market. Topple the oligarchs. Send a message that inequality won’t be accepted. That war profiteers and criminals will be prosecuted. Tear down their racist institutions. Become ungovernable.</p><p>Create something better. An equal world where people are useful to each other. A world where your value comes from your humanity rather than what you provide to the economy. Create a society that respects the world as something sacred rather than a treasure to be pillaged. Build cities around people rather than cars.</p><p>I know things look bleak right now. I can’t lie and say I that I see a way out of this. We’ve dug a hole so deep we can’t even see the sun shining anymore. But don’t be tempted to despair. Disillusion and cynicism has killed the spirit of the generations before you. The work ahead of you is great and will involve a lot of blood, sweat, and tears, but it’s doable.</p><p>Be genuine.</p><p>Be kind.</p><p>Be radical.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on March 17, 2024</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer><nav class="pagination"><div class="pagination__title"><span>Read other posts</span></div><div class="pagination__buttons"><a href="https://frizz.dev/you-cant-negotiate-with-terrorists/" class="btn previous" rel="prev" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  You can&#x27;t negotiate with terrorists "><span class="btn__icon">←</span> <span class="btn__text">You can&#x27;t negotiate with terrorists</span> </a><a href="https://frizz.dev/we-are-living-in-the-post-apocolypse/" class="btn next" rel="next" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  We are living in the post-apocalypse "><span class="btn__text">We are living in the post-apocalypse</span> <span class="btn__icon">→</span></a></div></nav></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__inner"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>© 2024 Powered by Publii CMS :: <a href="https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Theme</a> ported by the <a href="https://getpublii.com/customization-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Publii Team</a></p></div></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://frizz.dev/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=74fad06980c30243d91d72c7c57fcdb8"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
