According to their chief, they could have been shot, so they did nothing. In fact, they did more than nothing. They stopped a Border Patrol team from entering the school because they didn’t believe the children were in danger. At that time children were on the line with 911 begging for help. Later, police action would directly lead to the death of a child. They tried to cover it up. It seems doubtful any of these officers or leaders will be held accountable.</p><p><a href="https://www.aaastateofplay.com/the-50-schools-in-america-with-the-most-toxic-air" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">In Verona, Missouri, children are exposed to toxic air 665 times worse than the national average</a>. The BCP Ingredients plant has lead to a substantial increase in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and in some areas a 27 times higher than acceptable cancer risk. <a href="https://metrostl.com/2022/03/28/state-launches-cancer-study-after-toxic-air-pollution-hot-spot-is-identified/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">The plant says they are within state and federal compliance</a>. The EPA may fund another study but nothing else is happening.</p><p>Kanakuk, an evangelical Christian camp in Branson, <a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2022/05/26/kanakuk-kamps-abuse-unreported-decades-victims-say-missouri-pete-newman/9803409002/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">has been a haven for pedophiles for over thirty years</a>. According to campers and counselors alike, nudity was a part of the camp’s culture. <a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2022/05/26/camp-kanakuk-nudity-culture-hid-abuse-grooming-pete-newman-branson/9654342002/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">This “culture” included adults showering with children, watching them bathe, and inspecting their genitals for ticks.</a> <a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2022/05/26/kanakuk-kamps-camper-reported-sexual-assault-denied-call-home-leave/9827342002/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">A camper who was sexually assaulted by another camper was told to forgive her attacker and not allowed to call her parents.</a> Other campers who were molested were given gifts in exchange for signing a non-disclosure agreement. Kanakuk has faced no legal action and continues to operate.</p><p><a href="https://abuseguardian.com/agape-boarding-school-abuse-lawsuit-stockton-missouri-facility-under-investigation/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Agape Boys Ranch, a boarding “school” that moved into SW Missouri in 1990s because of a lack of regulation, has been abusing children for years</a>. <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article256914712.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">The facility’s doctor has been charged with multiple counts of child sex abuse.</a> He lived with two other staff members who have also been charged with sexual abuse. This man, who by law is a mandatory reporter, preyed on children for years. Law enforcement repeatedly refused to do anything until the KC Star and Springfield News-Leader began reporting on the school.</p><p>Circle of Hope Girls Ranch, another SW MO reformatory boarding school, faces similar charges. The ranch —now closed— was founded by a former employee of Agape in 2006 and almost immediately was the subject of abuse allegations. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/girls-alleged-abuse-reform-school-years-it-stayed-open-until-n1241011" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">In 2008 the Missouri Department of Education told a parent they could do nothing about the ranch because it wasn’t a licensed school</a>. That same year the Department of Social Services had received three complaints about the school, one of physical abuse and two of sexual abuse. Nothing ever came of those complaints. Sixteen years later the founders of the ranch face 100 criminal charges.</p><p><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/correction-christian-boarding-schools-missouri-story-83932551" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">It wasn’t until 2022 that the state of Missouri decided to do the bare minimum in regulating these so-called schools.</a> They don’t have to be licensed but all employees must be subject to a background check, adequate food and healthcare must be given to students, and parents are allowed access to their children with no prior notice.</p><p>During the pandemic, children were routinely the subject of public health experiments. Should they wear masks? Yes, but then no, but then yes. Should school be virtual? Yes, give every kid a laptop and who cares if they have a quiet place to do work. Actually, no, they need to come back to school unless someone tests positive and then the whole class needs to go home. Are there parents at home? Who knows. Do they have enough food to eat? Who cares.</p><p>After years of being jerked around by school boards made up of home builders and wannabe politicians, it’s become obvious these kids were robbed of a proper education. They lost years of their education and for what? I guess so they can grow up to be robbed of their wages by employers.</p><p><strong>I think it’s time for us to finally admit it: the society we live in hates our children.</strong></p><p>Even before they are born, they are subject to forces beyond their control. For absolutely no reason those born without enough food have to jump through increasingly smaller hoops in order to get public assistance. If you’re not lucky enough to have a parent with health insurance good luck trying to get on Medicaid. And even when you do, good luck finding a doctor’s office that will take it without lengthy delays. Where you lives determines what school you go to. Unsurprisingly, richer areas have better schools.</p><p>The deck is so stacked against kids. And every year it’s made more difficult to even survive. All of this for no reason at all. The United States is one of the wealthiest nations on earth and yet we find it better for one man to hoard billions of dollars rather than provide for all citizens. We would rather bomb villages thousands of miles away instead of providing safety for school children. We would rather scream about religious freedom than take care of the most vulnerable.</p><p>One of my core political tenets is solidarity. What happens to one, happens to all. Standing up for those who are vulnerable, for those who are weak, for those who are afraid is one of the most important things we can do. Standing against those who would use children as shields for their regressive politics is the purest form of solidarity.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on March 17, 2024</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer><nav class="pagination"><div class="pagination__title"><span>Read other posts</span></div><div class="pagination__buttons"><a href="https://frizz.dev/the-traffic-congestion-con-2/" class="btn previous" rel="prev" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  The traffic congestion con "><span class="btn__icon">←</span> <span class="btn__text">The traffic congestion con</span> </a><a href="https://frizz.dev/local-neighborhoods-defeat-political-establishment/" class="btn next" rel="next" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  Local neighborhoods defeat political establishment "><span class="btn__text">Local neighborhoods defeat political establishment</span> <span class="btn__icon">→</span></a></div></nav></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__inner"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>© 2024 Powered by Publii CMS :: <a href="https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Theme</a> ported by the <a href="https://getpublii.com/customization-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Publii Team</a></p></div></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://frizz.dev/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=74fad06980c30243d91d72c7c57fcdb8"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
