I’m not being sarcastic, this is really good news and shows that the people do have some power over the builders and developers who run this city. A rare win, and one that should give us courage in the future.</p><p>Royce Redding, local weasel and former Billy Long staffer, owns the property that was to be turned into a drive through. The lot, which has been vacant for years and occasionally serves as a place for community yard sales, is zoned as residential and Redding wanted the zoning changed to allow a new 7 Brew. (Because there aren’t enough already.)</p><p>The plan for the lot, after multiple rejections by the zoning board, was to have an entrance and exit on both Jefferson and Roanoke. Roanoke, a small residential street. This was done presumably because anyone of average intelligence could see that Sunshine wouldn’t be able to handle the added traffic. So they tried to pawn it off onto neighborhood streets. They also magnanimously offered to plant some trees on the back of the property.</p><p>Of course, none of this would benefit the people who live in the surrounding area, myself included. Their own research shows the majority of customers would be people driving along Sunshine. I wouldn’t be able to hop on my bike and ride over for a coffee because it’s a drive through only. I understand that no one is going to build a home on that corner (although an apartment building?), but a business should benefit the neighborhood.</p><p>I’m not glad we won because I’m some sort of home-value NIMBY. I was OK with the apartments built along the Greenway off of Sunset. I was OK with the 55+ duplexes on the other side of the street. I wouldn’t do anything to fight against more housing or responsible businesses because that’s good for the community. What’s not good for the community is another drive through restaurant with a line of cars flowing out into the streets. Starbucks, McDonalds, and the chicken nugget places already do enough of that.</p><p>It also doesn’t hurt that Royce Redding lost.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on March 17, 2024</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer><nav class="pagination"><div class="pagination__title"><span>Read other posts</span></div><div class="pagination__buttons"><a href="https://frizz.dev/moloch-in-america/" class="btn previous" rel="prev" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  Moloch in America "><span class="btn__icon">←</span> <span class="btn__text">Moloch in America</span> </a><a href="https://frizz.dev/you-cant-negotiate-with-terrorists/" class="btn next" rel="next" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  You can&#x27;t negotiate with terrorists "><span class="btn__text">You can&#x27;t negotiate with terrorists</span> <span class="btn__icon">→</span></a></div></nav></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__inner"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>© 2024 Powered by Publii CMS :: <a href="https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Theme</a> ported by the <a href="https://getpublii.com/customization-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Publii Team</a></p></div></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://frizz.dev/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=74fad06980c30243d91d72c7c57fcdb8"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
